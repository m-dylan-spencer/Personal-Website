	abstract = {Criminal justice is deeply connected to society, with policing and corrections under much recent global scrutiny. Teaching complex subjects is common, but criminal justice classes are unquietly challenging. Students seeking policing or corrections careers share classrooms with skeptics, complicating rapport and curriculum design. This research utilizes surveys from criminal justice students to explore their interest and perspectives regarding policing and corrections topics. It identifies the most appealing subjects in these areas, perceptions of fairness, and students’ preferred career choices. Students expressed a strong interest in learning about policing and corrections topics, particularly the lived experiences of practitioners and justice-involved individuals. Overall, respondents felt these topics were presented and discussed fairly in the classroom. While students generally viewed policing careers as more desirable than those in corrections, many expressed significant interest in careers working with juveniles. Pedagogical implications, including a variety of high impact practices, are discussed.},
